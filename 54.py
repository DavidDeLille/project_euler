# In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
# - High Card: Highest value card.
# - One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
# - Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
# - Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
# - Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
# - Flush: All cards of the same suit.
# - Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
# - Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
# - Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
# - Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
# The cards are valued in the order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
# If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). 
# But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); 
# if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
# (website contains extra example)
#
# The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. 
# Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. 
# You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
# How many hands does Player 1 win?

# The idea:
# If we get 2 hands, we can assign a absolute score for each hand, and compare the resulting numbers.
# The score I devised consists of 15 digits (the leading ones can be zero).
# The first digit represents the class of the hand (flush, 4-of-a-kind, etc.). This is because the class is the most important aspect of the hand.
#Â The next 4 digits represent some more detail about the class. These are only used for pairs, triples and full houses. The first 2 show the highest pair/triple and the last 2 show the lowest pair.
# The final 10 digits represent the values of the cards (in descending order). This is used to compare 2 hands in the same class.

# Example 1: 5H 5C 6S 7S KD (Pair of Fives) ==> 100051307060505
# The leading 1 indicates that the class is a pair
# 00 05, shows that there is only 1 pair, and that it is a pair of fives (note that high cards can't be used to compare which pair/double_pair/triple/full house is better)
# 13 07 06 05 05 are the values of the cards; this shows there is a queen, a seven, a six, and 2 fives

# Example 1: 3D 6D 7D TD QD (Flush with Diamonds) ==> 400001210070603
# The leading 4 indicates that the class is a flush
# The next 4 digits are 00 00, because only high cards are looked at in the case of comparing flushes, so there is no need for extra information
# 13 07 06 05 05 are the values of the cards; this shows there is a queen, a seven, a six, and 2 fives
